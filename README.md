# Financial Planning Tools for Retirement (Challenge #5 of FinTech Bootcamp)

In this challenge, I used API calls to pull price information for a retirement portfolio, applied statistical concepts, and used Monte Carlo simulations to forecast its performance over time.

## Technologies

This project uses Python 3.7 and imports the following packages:

[pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org/docs/) - For data structuring and analysis.

[dotnev](https://www.npmjs.com/package/dotenv) - For API credentials in environment variable.

[os](https://docs.python.org/3/library/os.html) - For OS functionality to get API keys in .env

[requests](https://docs.python-requests.org/en/master/) - For API calls parsing

[json](https://www.json.org/json-en.html) - For API data readability

[MCForecastTools](https://github.com/vmieres/Personal-Finance-Planer-Retirement-Planing/blob/main/MCForecastTools.py) - For MonteCarlo simulations

[alpaca_trade_api](https://alpaca.markets/docs/) - For price information on stocks and bonds

[alternative.me](https://alternative.me/crypto/api/) - For price information on crypto assets

## Lessons Learned

1- Made API calls using the <code>requests</code> library and SDK to get current data.

2- Used environment variables to protect private API credentials

3- Applied statistical concepts, like probability distributions and confidence intervals, to measure the likelihood of future events

4- Built and ran Monte Carlo simulations to evaluate the long-term future performance outcomes for portfolios.
